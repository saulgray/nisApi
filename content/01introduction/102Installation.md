## Installation 
NIS can be installed either via installer using the URL NEM Infrastructure Server or as stand-alone package which is hosted on http://bob.nem.ninja/. The installer only supports 64 bit versions of Java. The current stand-alone version as of this writing is nis-ncc-0.5.13.tgz. When using the installer both installation and the start-up of the software is automatic. The stand-alone version needs to be unzipped to a directory of your choice. It is then started by running runNis.bat (windows) or nix.runNis.sh (linux) from the command prompt.
