## Transaction objects 
### ImportanceTransferTransaction 
#### Description: 
NIS has the ability to transfer the importance of one account to another account for harvesting. The account receiving the importance is called the remote account. Importance transfer transactions are part of the secure harvesting feature of NEM. Once an importance transaction has been included in a block it needs 6 hours to become active.

### MultisigAggregateModificationTransaction 
#### Description: 
Multisig aggregate modification transactions are part of the NEM's multisig account system. A multisig aggregate modification transaction holds an array of multisig cosignatory modifications and a single multisig minimum cosignatories modification inside the transaction. A multisig aggregate modification transaction can be wrapped by a multisig transaction. Aggregate modification transactions that use the minCosignatories field need to have version 0x68000002 (decimal 1744830466) for mainnet and 0x98000002 (decimal -1744830462) for testnet.
