## CommunicationTimeStamps 
**Description:**
 
Communication timestamps contain information about the network time of a remote NIS. NEM uses a time synchronization mechanism to synchronize time across the network. Each node maintains a network time which is the time of the computer clock plus an offset which compensates for the deviation from the computer clocks of other nodes.

 
**JSON structure by example:**
