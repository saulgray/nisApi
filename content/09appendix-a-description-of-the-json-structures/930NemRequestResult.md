## NemRequestResult 
Some requests such as announcing a new transaction return detailed information about the outcome of the request. In those cases the result of the request is returned in a special JSON object called NemRequestResult. The structure is typically used for requests that perform validation or return a status.

 
#### JSON structure by example: 
```json
{
        "type": 4,
        "code": 6,
        "message": "status"
        }
``` 
#### Description of the fields: 

| Parameter | Description |
|------|------|
| type | The type is dependent on the request which was answered. The interpretation of the code field depends on the type. Currently the following types are supported:  1:  The result is a validation result.2:  The result is a heart beat result.4:  The result indicates a status.  |
| code | The meaning of the code is dependent on the type. For type 1 (validation result) only 0 and 1 mean there was no failure. For a complete list of validation results see Appendix B: NIS Errors The following codes are the most frequent ones occurring: 0: Neutral result. A typical example would be that a node validates an incoming transaction and realizes that it already knows about the transaction. In this case it is neither a success (meaning the node has a new transaction) nor a failure (because the transaction itself is valid).1: Success result. A typical example would be that a node validates a new valid transaction.2: Unknown failure. The validation failed for unknown reasons.3: The entity that was validated has already past its deadline.4: The entity used a deadline which lies too far in the future.5: There was an account involved which had an insufficient balance to perform the operation.6: The message supplied with the transaction is too large.7: The hash of the entity which got validated is already in the database.8: The signature of the entity could not be validated.9: The entity used a timestamp that lies too far in the past.10: The entity used a timestamp that lies in the future which is not acceptable.11: The entity is unusable.12: The score of the remote block chain is inferior (although a superior score was promised).13: The remote block chain failed validation.14: There was a conflicting importance transfer detected.15: There were too many transaction in the supplied block.16: The block contains a transaction that was signed by the harvester.17: A previous importance transaction conflicts with a new transaction.18: An importance transfer activation was attempted while previous one is active.19: An importance transfer deactivation was attempted but is not active.  For type 2 the following codes are supported: 1: Successful heart beat detected.  For type 3 the following codes are supported: 0: Unknown status.1: NIS is stopped.2: NIS is starting.3: NIS is running.4: NIS is booting the local node (implies NIS is running).5: The local node is booted (implies NIS is running).6: The local node is synchronized (implies NIS is running and the local node is booted).7: There is no remote node available (implies NIS is running and the local node is booted).8: NIS is currently loading the block chain.  |
